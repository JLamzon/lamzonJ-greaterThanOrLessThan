//Greater than or less than, data validation and play again
Peer Review: Marcel R. The program runs well, no errors or anything. It has play again functionality and will check if the number entered is an int. Also has if else statements for different scenarios and uses break to break out. One comment I have is that typing No for do you want to play again doesn't work, but adding .ToLower() would be an easy fix. Awesome work!
